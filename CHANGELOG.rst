Changelog

``pinnwand`` is Python pastebin software that tried to keep it simple but got
a little more complex.

v1.6.1 (unreleased)
*******************
* Removed the default indentation from pastes. It now only applies to configured 
  languages again. Opened a public discussion about this behavior.
* Conditionally discover e2e testcases only when playwright is available in
  the environment. Closes #284.

v1.6.0 (20241101)
*******************
* Added a browser test suite by nekhvoya_.
* Minify the container images by williamjmorenor_.
* Fix project metadata in `pyproject.toml` by NeilHanlon_.
* A new `show` route in the v1 API to view a paste.
* Logging has been reworked by shtlrs_.
* Deprecated `log.warn` has been fixed by wookie184_.
* Better user-facing errors by wookie184_.
* Added new buttons on the view paste page nekhvoya_.
* Fix custom logo handlers to actually show the logo.
* Various configuration and log reworks and refactoring by shtlrs_.

v1.5.0 (20230727)
*****************
* Change the tab size in the HTML to be 4.
* List lexer endpoint in configuration by ChrisLovering_.
* Reorder Containerfile to optimise caching by ChrisLovering_.
* Logo is now limited on height, allowing for banner-style logos by ChrisLovering_.
* Make environment variable parsing better by accepting `SyntaxError` by ChrisLovering_.
* Allow selecting the default lexer in configuration by ChrisLovering_.
* Ctrl+S now submits pastes by ChrisLovering_.
* `pdm` is now used as the build backend and package solution.
* Containers are now published by CI to GHCR_ by ChrisLovering_.
* Add line range(s) highlight support.
* Add file upload (drag-and-drop or file picker) support.

v1.4.0 (20221127)
*****************
Focus on prettier pages, ease of development, and more defensive posturing. The
`reap` subcommand is now deprecated and instead ran in-process.

A big change is the fact that you can now configure ``pinnwand`` through
environment variables, this makes running in containerized systems a fair bit
easier.

For _packagers_, if you previously shipped timer units for `reap` you can remove
them from your packages in this new version.

* A `Containerfile` is now provided by default. This allows developers to build
  a container.
* If only a single file is pasted the code area for this single file is now
  larger.
* Update major versions of some dependencies.
* Replace the `toml` dependency with the maintained `tomli`.
* Provide example systemd service and timer file for reaping expired pastes.
* The CSS is now generated from SASS, this means that you need `sassc`
  installed if you want to change/rebuild assets.
* The `reap` subcommand is deprecated and will be removed in `1.6`, it now
  runs when the `http` subcommand is running every 1800 seconds instead. The
  example files for `reap` have been removed as well.
* ``pinnwand`` can now be configured through environment variables, these
  start with `PINNWAND_` and are all upper case, then the prefix is removed
  and the key lowercased. This *overwrites* any previously set value.
* `isort` was added to `pre-commit` checks.
* The package layout has been changed to a src-layout, if you are running tests
  with a `pytest < 7` you will need the additional `pytest-srcpaths` plugin.
* Configuration examples have moved to the `etc/` subdirectory.
